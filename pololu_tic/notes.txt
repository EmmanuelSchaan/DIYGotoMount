Once the tic is connected to the raspberry pi, type:
ticcmd --list
to check that it is recognized

Type ticcmd
to get a list of all commands

Then type:
ticgui
to start the gui and control the stepper motor!

Latest working settings, for the geared stepper motor with 1:100 reduction
1/16 microstepping
max speed: 40k steps/sec
max acceleration: 40k steps/sec^2
a 180 turn of the camera mount took about 18 sec, looked good visually.

When going back and forth at high speed, it is possible that some steps were lost: the mount seemed not to go back exactly where it started. 
This may be due to my abruptly halting the motor.
This may require an encoder to fix.
This may also be fixed with a slower acceleration.
